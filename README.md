# DisCrasher [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/LICENSE-MIT-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/AXDZ/LOOKIP/blob/master/LICENSE)
A golang based script which uses an user account to rapidly change a group name which causes the discord to crash.

## USAGE
You will need to install [colors](https://github.com/fatih/color) package and then replace token variable with an user token in the script
. Then you will be able to run it by simply doing command ```go run discrasher.go```. Also keep in mind you will need golang installed for this to work! Once you run it you will get prompted to enter the group id, so enter it that and hit enter. Running this on multiple processes increases performance of the crasher.

## DISCLAIMER
This is suppose to use a user account which can be marked as self botting. It can result in your discord account termination. Im not responsible for your actions.
