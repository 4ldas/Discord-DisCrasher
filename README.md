# DisCrasher
A rust based script which uses a bot's or user's account to rapidly change a guild name/settings which causes the discord to lag/freeze and even crash!

## DISCLAIMER
If you use a discord user account this can be marked self botting. As far as im aware if you do it as a bot it can also be marked as a api abuse! It can result in your discord account termination. Im not responsible for your actions.
