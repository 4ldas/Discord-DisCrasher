# DisCrasher
A rust based CLI application which uses a bot's or user's account to rapidly change a guild name/settings which causes the discord to lag/freeze and even crash!

## DOWNLOAD
You can download the bin at the [releases page](https://github.com/AXDZ/DisCrasher/releases "releases page")

## COMPILING
If you wanted to self compile it. You will need cargo installed on your machine you can find more info on installion [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install "installation"), from then on will have to clone the directory of the crasher or download. Now you want to enter the directory that you cloned it to then from then on run a command ```cargo build --release```. This will build a release optimised version. Once you have done that there will be a folder called target, now you want to enter the folder target and from then on enter the folder releases. Now the the executable will be aiready there, type depending on your platform. Now you can take the executable and place wherever you want.

## USAGE
You can add a ```-h``` parameter at the end to see all parameters. This is CLI application keep in mind so you will have to use it from a terminal of your choice! Also do keep in mind you will need manage server permissions to be able to do this!

## DISCLAIMER
If you use a discord user account this can be marked self botting. As far as im aware if you do it as a bot it can also be marked as a api abuse! It can result in your discord account termination. Im not responsible for your actions.
